Here are some test voice samples generated by Amazon Polly.

Please let me know on IRC or by email which voice you prefer and why.

Translations of langs/ are welcome and will result in Native spoken prompts
in your language!

See voices.json for the supported voices.

I'm unsure if i can redistribute these, so for now I'm just including the
script I used to generate them..

You'll need the AWS cli from:
	https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

Good luck!
